# Project Name: Sensory Feedback Prosthetic Arm
# Group Members: Ama Nimako, Obioma Chukwuocha, Justin Cruz
# Goals: Create a Prosthetic Arm with both the basic functionalities of a prosthetic (finger movement, hand movement), and further implement sensory feedback. With this technology, we plan to incorporate a system under which the user will be able to be aware of the temperature for which the Prosthetic Arm can "feel".
